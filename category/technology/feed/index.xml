<p><strong>Chatgpt is an artificial intelligence language model developed by openAI. It stands for Generative Pre-trained transformer. It is an AI chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. ChatGPT is like a really smart computer program that understands how people talk and can chat with you like a person. It learned a lot from reading tons of stuff on the internet, so it’s good at having conversations, giving information, and even creating text on different topics. Chatgpt is a form of AI tools that can generate a text created by using AI according to the prompt given by a user.</strong></p>
